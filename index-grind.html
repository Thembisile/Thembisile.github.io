  <p>The main feature of Table Mountain is the level plateau approximately 3 kilometres
    (2 mi) from side to side, edged by impressive cliffs. The plateau, flanked by
    Devil's Peak to the east and by Lion's Head to the west, forms a dramatic backdrop
     to Cape Town. This broad sweep of mountainous heights, together with Signal Hill,
    forms the natural amphitheatre of the City Bowl and Table Bay harbour. </p>

   The Port of Cape Town is the port of the city of Cape Tow
   n, South Africa. It is situated in Table Bay.
Because of its position
along one of the world's busiest trade routes it is one of
the busiest ports in South Africa, handling the largest amount
of fresh fruit and second only to Durban as a container port. The
 port also has significant repair and maintenance facilities that are
 used by several large fishing fleets and parts of the West African oil industry.
  Because of the many tourist attractions offered by Cape Town and
its surrounding region, many cruise ships also berth in the port.
